# Software_Developer_Salary_Predictor
Nowadays, Major reason an employee switches the company is the salary of the employee. 
Employees keep switching the company to get the expected salary. 
And it leads to loss of the company and to overcome this loss we came with an idea what 
if the employee gets the desired/expected salary from the Company or Organization. 
In this Competitive world everyone has a higher expectation and goals. 
But we cannot randomly provide everyone their expected salary there should be a system which should measure the ability of the Employee for the Expected salary.
We cannot decide the exact salary but we can predict it by using certain data sets. 
A prediction is an assumption about a future event. 
So we created a web app project “software developer salary predictor”. 
Through which software developers can see:-
-Expected salary based on country, education and years of professional experience

-Mean salary based on country in graphical format

-Mean salary based on experience in graphical format

-Comparison of salaries between different countries

Through our project a user who is a software developer can get an idea of his salary based on 
the country he resides in, education and years of experience in the professional field.
Apart from that the user will also be able to see mean salary based on country, 
experience and compare salaries between different countries.
